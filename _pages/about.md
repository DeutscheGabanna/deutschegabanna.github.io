My story with tech begins when I was nine years old and received my first used PC - the kind equipped with a CRT monitor and a famous *Turbo* button.

My first ever introduction to programming was **Pascal**, but I never took a liking to it and swiftly moved on.

Then, in my teens, I developed simple **CLI apps in C++** on Windows. It helped me grasp the idea and the benefits of an **object-oriented approach** to development. Most of those were text-based adventure games, some were actually of some utility and helped me remember English vocabulary, for instance.

Also in my teens I began dabbling in web development, but the technology at that point wasn't as convenient as it is today. I had to put up with FTP file transfers using Total Commander and paying outrageous fees for hosting out of my own pocket.

At Allegro, I mostly focused on learning **Python**. I am the author and a sole maintainer of an open-source [file converter](/repositories#my-github-repositories). This project-based path lead me to discover technologies such as **Docker** (and its competitor **Podman**) and concepts such as **unit-testing** and **distributed work systems**.

I would like to continue learning not only on my spare time, as I do currently, **but in a professional capacity** as a programmer.
