                <h2>A versatile tech-enthusiast, not-so-versatile painter, writer and gamer.</h2>
                <p>If you couldn't tell from the heading, I had actually used a type-writer for writing some of my books.</p>
                <p>Coming back to tech-side of my life, however, the story begins when I was nine years old and received my first used PC - the kind equipped with a CRT monitor and a famous Turbo button.</p>
                <p>My first ever introduction to programming was Pascal, but I never took a liking to it and swiftly moved on.</p>
                <p>
                    Then, in my teens, I developed simple CLI apps in C++ on Windows. It helped me grasp the idea and the benefits of an object-oriented approach to development. 
                    Most of those were text-based adventure games, some were actually of some utility and helped me remember English vocabulary, for instance. 
                    Also in my teens I began dabbling in web development, but the technology at that point wasn’t as convenient as it is today. 
                    I had to put up with FTP file transfers using Total Commander and paying outrageous fees for hosting out of my own pocket.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At Allegro, I mostly focused on learning Python. 
                    I am the author and a sole maintainer of an open-source file converter. 
                    This project-based path lead me to discover technologies such as Docker (and its competitor Podman) and concepts such as unit-testing and distributed work systems.
                </p>
                <p>I would like to continue learning not only on my spare time, as I do currently, but in a professional capacity as a programmer.</p>
